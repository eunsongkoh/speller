Code for the CS50x final C project, Speller.c
Includes code for dictionary.c

Speller.C “focused on dereferencing and general low-level access to computer memory using hash tables and linked lists*”. Implementing a pre-made spell checker, I stored and read the files, indexing in the values efficiently as possible, cross referencing into a dictionary, while finally returning the number of words in the dictionary and outputting the amount of time it took.
